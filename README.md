# testSctpa

A portable toolkit for pathway activity score calculation

## Introduction
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis enables researchers to uncover more refined and novel cell clusters, which have greatly advanced our understanding of cellular states. Pathway activity score (PAS) analysis has been applied to transform the gene-level data into explainable gene sets representing biological processes or pathways to uncover the potential mechanism of cell heterogeneity. 
This package provide several portable interfaces for PAS calculation tools.
